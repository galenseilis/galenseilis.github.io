I've come to a stage where I accept that I have more project ideas than I have time. So feel free to pick up on any of these ideas if you're looking for something to work on! Let me know if you or someone has already done these projects.

# Tool Development

# Kedro
- [ ] Develop plugin to run PyCallGraph2 on the nodes, generating a call graph that ignores that Kedro code itself.
- [ ] Develop `ESRIShapeFileDataset` for common geospatial analysis.
- [ ] Develop `ProphetModelDataset` using Prophets load/save methods.

# Analysis
- [ ] Use [COBRApy](https://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1752-0509-7-74) to simulate *Cyanidioschyzon merolae*.
- [ ] Develop statistical forecasting model of venting index in British Columbia, Canada.
