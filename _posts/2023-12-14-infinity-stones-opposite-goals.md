I asked this question on a stack exchange site, but I [deleted it](https://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/121648/what-would-happen-if-the-infinity-stones-were-in-contact-with-two-characters-wit) since it was poorly received. I think it is a fun, if not frivilous, question. Feel free to leave comments below my post here on my blog! :)


## Question

> I am entertaining a hypothetical. The infinity stones seem to work by having them in direct or near-direct contact (skin or gauntlet)... or something like that ğŸ¤· Basic point is there is some set of criteria for a given character to be able to use one-or-more of the stones.
>
> Adjacent to my question is an observation that:
>
> During the battle to protect Xandar, by sharing the burden of the Power Stone's energy, the Guardians are able to use it to kill Ronan. It is later revealed that Peter Quill's half-Celestial physiology was what allows him to withstand the Stone's power on his own for a brief time before the other Guardians joined with him.
>
> At least from what I remember in the movie, it was primarily Quill that wielded the stone willed the destruction of Ronan and that the other characters supported him in a way that prevented Quill from dying.
>
> So to my question:
>
> Suppose two characters, both equally-capable of controlling a set of stones on their own, are both in "sufficiently in contact" with the stones. Also suppose that both characters will for opposite (mutually exclusive) things to happen via the stone.
>
> What would determine what happens?
