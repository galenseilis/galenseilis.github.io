I've had this idea in the back of my mind for a while. It would be an interesting problem if data were available.

At a glance a pile of moose poop might be randomly-oriented, but upon closer inspection I have found that many piles have a stacking behaviour. Those pieces of scat that arrive early may be constraining how following scat can come to rest.

Knowing whether moose scat lands in random orientation would be a first step in trying to develop a calibration between the direction that a moose was
standing and the direction its scat falls.

A limitation of this approach is that if the earlier scat lands random, but the dependent scat doesnâ€™t, then the overall non-randomness could be misleading.

Some the covariates are the ground obstacles such as rocks, logs, stumps, and vegetation, but also the ground slope, and mass.
