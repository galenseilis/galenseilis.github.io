I asked ChatGPT to write a song about life after love. This is what is came up with:

> Verse 1:
>
> Love was once a dream that I held tight,
But now it's gone, it's out of sight,
I tried to find it, but it was all in vain,
Now it's time to move on, and let go of the pain.
>
>Chorus:
>
> Love may be gone, but I'm not scared,
No more tears to cry, and no more to share,
I've found solace in my solitude,
And I'll find joy in the life I pursue.
>
>Verse 2:
>
>I thought love was something that I'd need,
But now I know, it's just a dream,
I've learned to accept that I'll be alone,
And I've found comfort in making my own home.
>
>Chorus:
>
>Love may be gone, but I'm not scared,
No more tears to cry, and no more to share,
I've found solace in my solitude,
And I'll find joy in the life I pursue.
>
>Bridge:
>
>I'll find happiness in my own company,
And the things that make my heart sing,
I'll live my life in harmony,
And find peace in the joy it brings.
>
>Chorus:
>
>Love may be gone, but I'm not scared,
No more tears to cry, and no more to share,
I've found solace in my solitude,
And I'll find joy in the life I pursue.
>
>Outro:
>
>Love may have been a fleeting dream,
But it's okay, I've found my own scheme,
I'll live my life on my own terms,
And find happiness in the lessons I've learned.
