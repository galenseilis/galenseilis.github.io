> What is ontological infinity?

> **Answer**
>
> Ontological infinity is a concept in philosophy that refers to the idea that there exists an infinite number of entities or objects in the world, whether physical or abstract. In other words, it is the notion that the universe or reality itself is infinite in some sense.
>
> Ontological infinity has been explored in various fields of philosophy, including metaphysics, epistemology, and theology. Some philosophers have argued that an infinite number of entities is necessary to account for certain phenomena, such as the infinite divisibility of matter, while others have suggested that an infinite number of entities is logically impossible or that it leads to paradoxes and contradictions.
>
> Overall, the idea of ontological infinity remains a subject of ongoing debate and discussion among philosophers and scholars.
