    alt: A Generalization of the d'Alembert operator could be a lemon

According to one of my old notebooks, I came up with a generalization of the d'Alembert operator between 2022-03-27 and 2022-05-20. I can't say that it was well-motivated by a particular mathematical or physical problem. It was just some low-hanging fruit in terms of mathematical generalization.

First, let us start with the definition of the d'Alembert in rectangular coordinates:

> **Definition** 
>
> The [d'Alembert operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Alembert_operator) in rectangular coordinates is given by
>
> $$\square \triangleq \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} - \sum_{j=1}^3 \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_j^2}$$
>
> where $c$ is the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light) in some desired choice of units.

It is then clear that the following generalization allows for different orders of partial derivative in any number of dimensions in rectangular coordinates.

> **Definition**
>
> The generalized d'Alembert operator in rectangular coordinates is given by
>
> $$\square_k \triangleq \frac{1}{\alpha^k} \frac{\partial^k}{\partial t^k} - \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{\partial^k}{\partial x_j^k}$$
> 
> which can also be written as
>
> $$\square_k \triangleq \frac{1}{\alpha^k} \frac{\partial^k}{\partial t^k} - \vec 1_n \cdot \left( \bigodot_{i=1}^{k} \nabla_{\vec x} \right)$$
>
> where $\alpha$ is a parameter , and  $\bigodot$ is the element-wise product.

Mathematically the d'Alembert has a relationship to the curvature of manifolds, but its generalization will certainly have a less-direct relationship to curvature for $k \neq 2$.
