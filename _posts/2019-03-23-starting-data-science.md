I've been thinking about [Data Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) lately, and I recently watched a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTxyviU0Ddo) describing how to get started learning prerequisite knowledge for this field. While I am skeptical of the use of buzzwords, I think *data science* does reflect a loose collection of ideas and tools that are interesting and useful. Some of these subtopics include [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics), [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm), [databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database), [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), and other miscellaneous topics within [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) and [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics). I'm not partial to the term, but I am to the associated skillset.

In the interest of learning this subject in a structured way, I am going to go through the curricula suggested by [Giles McMullen-Klein](http://www.dtc.ox.ac.uk/people/15/mcmullenkleing/). I'll modify it as it suites my needs or interests, but it serves as a simple template to get started with.
