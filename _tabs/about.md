# Employment

## Data Scientist

Northern Health (Nov 2022 - present)

## Data Analyst

Freelance (Jun 2021 - present)

I can provide you with services including data visualization, statistical estimation, simulations, network analysis, and mathematical modelling.

You can contact me on [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/galenseilis){:target="_blank"} for a consultation.

## Intern (Advanced Analytics)

Northern Health (June 2022 - Aug 2022)

I developed a process to forecast and monitor unplanned surgeries in northern British Columbia. This included an automated model refresh pipeline that delivered automated forecasts to a Tableau dashboard I developed.

Performed preliminary exploratory data analysis and modelling of estimated length of stay.

## Planting Quality Assurance Checker

Zanzibar Holdings Ltd. (May 2021)

Zanzibar Holdings Ltd. had obtained a contract to plant over two million trees in 2021. To help meet that goal I agreed to assist their team of foresters in ensuring quality control and assurance.

## Student Assistance

University of Northern British Columbia (Jan 2021 - Apr 2021)

Provided valuable feedback for students on their assignments and final exam.

I gave a guest lecture on relations and graphs to a classroom of students. This was a (successful) experiment in introducing graphs and binary relations together to a classroom familiar with basic set theory. I love explaining mathematics, and this approach of teaching both subjects together was motivated by the numerous similarities that can be drawn between graph theory and relations. I also emphasized to the class that mathematical ideas are applicable to practical applications, and shared some examples of research projects from my own student work.

## Software Developer

Norcan Consulting Ltd. (May 2020 - Aug 2020)

Design and development of tools to make GIS, field work, and data management easier. Frameworks, languages, and other tools included Javascript, Node, Cordova, Android, HTML, Postgresql, PostGIS, Geoserver, Openlayers 6, and QGIS.

## BioScience Technology Practicum Student

Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (2014-2014)
University of Saskatchewan

This position was the final chapter in acquiring a diploma in BioScience technology from the Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and Technology (SIAST), now known as Saskatchewan Polytechnic. Based on my interests, and aptitude, an academic advisor selected me to spend a month working at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada before considering my graduation.

During my time at this position, I was trained in multiple aspects of processing DNA sequences. In general, this included preparing and performing agarose gel electrophoresis, traditional PCR, qPCR, DNA barcoding/indexing, and performing DNA extractions and purifications from bacterial cultures in a laminar flow hood.
