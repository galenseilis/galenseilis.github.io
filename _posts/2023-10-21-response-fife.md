This post is the home page to a collection of responses to the following video, which gives the relevant context.

This is response is substantially later than I had intended. Between life being busy and flip-flopping on whether to develop a response in video (which I started but did not complete) or a written form. Even in written form I had started it as a $\LaTeX$ document along with a bunch of notes in an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault. Well, I've amalgamated these attempts to respond into a collection of blog posts that give some passing remarks on various aspects of Dustin's video. 

**TL;DR**: Neither Dustin or I think that nonparametric statistics are useless, but we still disagree on whether *rank-based* nonparametric statistics are useless.

Here they are, hopefully in some kind of coherent order:

I have enjoyed trying to unpack Dustin's video. It has given me an opportunity to think more thoroughly about how I understand a variety of concepts in Mathematics and Statistics. While I didn't pull any punches, I hope that Dustin feels that I have ernestly attempted to consider his point of view.
