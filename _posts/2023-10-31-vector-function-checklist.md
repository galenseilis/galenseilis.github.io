Suppose you have a function $f : \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \mathbb{R}^m$ and you want to learn about its properties. In this post I've enumerated a checklist of things you can think about or check about the function to understand it better.

- [ ] Domain and Range:
        Determine the domain (input values) and the range (output values) of the vector function.

- [ ] Dimension:
        Identify the dimension of the vector space in which the function operates. For example, is it a function in 2D, 3D, or higher dimensions?

- [ ] Continuity:
        Check if the function is continuous over its domain. This involves examining limits and continuity at specific points or along specific paths.

- [ ] Differentiability:
        Determine if the vector function is differentiable. If it is, calculate its derivatives, and check for smoothness.

- [ ] Derivatives:
        Analyze the first and higher-order derivatives, if applicable. This can provide insights into the function's behavior, critical points, and curvature.

- [ ] Gradient, Curl, divergence:
        Compute the gradient, curl, and Jacobian of the vector function to understand the direction and magnitude of change at different points.

- [ ] Integral Properties:
        Investigate the integral properties of the function, such as line integrals, surface integrals, and volume integrals. These can help analyze physical or geometric interpretations.

- [ ] Symmetry:
        Examine the function for any symmetry properties, such as rotational symmetry, reflection symmetry, or translational symmetry.

- [ ] Vector Operations:
        Analyze vector operations on the function, including addition, scalar multiplication, cross product, and dot product.

- [ ] Parametric Representation:
        Express the vector function in parametric form, which can help visualize the function's path or trajectory in space.

- [ ] Vector Magnitude:
        Calculate the magnitude of the vector function to determine its length or magnitude at various points.

- [ ] Unit Vector:
        Find the unit vector of the function to understand its direction.

- [ ] Determinant As A Linear Transform of the Unit Vector
    - Every vector function in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is in the span of the unit vector.

- [ ] Zero Vector:
        Check for any points where the vector function becomes the zero vector.

- [ ] Asymptotes:
        Identify any asymptotic behavior, such as limits as the independent variable approaches infinity.

- [ ] Periodicity:
        Determine if the function is periodic, and if so, find its period.

- [ ] Critical Points:
        Locate critical points where the derivative is zero or undefined. These points can indicate maxima, minima, or saddle points.

- [ ] Boundaries and End Behavior:
        Analyze the behavior of the vector function as it approaches the boundaries of its domain.

- [ ] Graphical Visualization:
        Create plots or graphs to visualize the vector function's path or surface in space.

- [ ] Physical Interpretation:
        If the vector function represents a physical system, consider its real-world interpretation. For instance, in physics, this might be the position, velocity, or force of an object.

- [ ] Applications:
        Consider the practical applications or implications of the vector function in the relevant field.
        
        
By examining these properties and characteristics, I hope you can gain a comprehensive understanding of a vector function and how it behaves in its respective space. Depending on the specific context and purpose of the vector function, some of these properties may be more or less relevant.
