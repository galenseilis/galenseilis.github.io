 
Suppose we are interesting in studying the order properties of some phenomena. Does that mean we have to use rank-based statistics? No. Just because we are studying orders doesn't mean we \textbf{have to} use rank-based statistics. The usefulness of rank-based statistics will depend on our goals and constraints. Let us consider some other approaches.\\
	
	Consider the example of social networks given in \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_QumFUv7C8}{Statistical Rethinking 2022 Lecture 15 - Social Networks} by Richard McElreath. I recommend watching the lecture, but for those short on time I will abstractly summarize. We might make measurements of trading and gifting between communities of people, and a graphical model may be a directed graph whose edges are the transactions between people (the nodes). A naive construction of such a network would be to include an edge between two people/communities if we have ever observed a transaction between them. This approach will tend to exaggerate the connectivity. Another approach is to compute a probability for each edge based on the transaction frequency probability that occurs in the same, which is a fine description of a sample but requires an interpretation of probability to make an inference about the population of transactions.\\
	
	Total and partial orders can be represented with a special type of mathematical concept called a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order)}{\textit{lattice}}. A lattice can be modelled as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) satisfying the property of being equal to its own \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_reduction}{transitive reduction}. In an analogous sense to McElreath's lecture on modelling social networks, we can consider sampling from a posterior distribution of lattices. Not that this is a trivial exercise however. \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13903}{Deleu \textit{et al.} 2022} discuss that sampling over DAGs, a superset of lattices for our purposes, can be biased or inefficient depending on the choice of algorithm. One of the challenges with using Markov chains to sample DAGs can be the long \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_mixing_time}{mixing times}. Sampling over lattices in particular could be even more difficult, but worthwhile for a fully Bayesian analysis of stochastic order on a set of variables.
