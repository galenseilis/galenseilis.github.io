This is a song I asked ChatGPT to write about [Pareto fronts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_front) sung to the lyrics of Gary Jules' *"Mad World"*. Here is the original song just to put the tune in your head.

Here are the lyrics produced by ChatGPT:

(Verse 1)

All around me are Pareto fronts,

Optimal points, where choices confront.

Stuck in a world of efficiency,

Where trade-offs reign, in perfect symmetry.


(Chorus)

Pareto fronts, they're everywhere,

Balancing acts, beyond compare.

Choices made, with careful hand,

In this world, where outcomes stand.


(Verse 2)

Silent choices, in the market's sway,

Efficient allocations, every single day.

Competing desires, in a complex dance,

Pareto fronts guide, with their nuanced glance.


(Chorus)

Pareto fronts, they're everywhere,

Balancing acts, beyond compare.

Choices made, with careful hand,

In this world, where outcomes stand.


(Bridge)

In the realms of production, in the bounds of trade,

Pareto fronts dictate, the prices paid.

From the smallest exchange, to grand policies,

Efficiency's anthem, sung in harmonies.


(Chorus)

Pareto fronts, they're everywhere,

Balancing acts, beyond compare.

Choices made, with careful hand,

In this world, where outcomes stand.


(Outro)

Pareto fronts, they're all around,

In every choice, they can be found.

Navigating the vast domain,

Pareto's legacy, forever reigns.
