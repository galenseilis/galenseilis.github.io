# Question

I'm interested in random tensor theory, and a part of that is random matrix theory. I'm reading from [Introduction to Random Matrices - Theory and Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07903) where they introduce the concept and necessity of 'freeness' as a generalization of mutual independence (see Section 17.2).

Does this property of 'freeness' generalize to tensors of rank greater than 2?
