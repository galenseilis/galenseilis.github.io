I'm very please to report that I have had my convocation! I officially graduated in Fall 2022 with a MSc in Computer Science.


I am grateful to all the people that helped me on my journey. Most of you know who you are, and perhaps a few of you do not.

Here is a video of the convocation ceremony. A friend pointed out to me that I cross the stage at about `1:52:34`, which I have included in the video embedding link.
