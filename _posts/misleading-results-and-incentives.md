	And I also think the costs are greater than the reward. So the benefit or the reward is that it is easier for the statistician but the cost is that you might have a misleading conclusion.

	I think that rank-based statistics can be misleading in ways similar to other statistics. Perhaps the greatest demonstration of this is the wide-spread misunderstanding of what these rank-based statistics quantify which in turn leads to dubious conclusions about the data.
	
	\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Quotation (Dustin Fife)]
	And if it is a misleading conclusion that gets you like super excited, like ``wow I discovered something amazing", and the actual model isn't so optimistic, you may not ever get to the point of following up with a ``proper" analysis because, why would you want to? The original model was good for your career.

	I think there is an excellent point near the end of this quote that scientists and other researchers should be vigilent about. It isn't really a point about rank-based statistics, or even statistics \textit{per se}. Either by mistake or deception a result may be incorrect. This could be due to choices in the statistical analysis, or it could be from laboratory procedures. Suppose a treatment is accidentally created by using a different pipetting method than the control, and this goes unnoticed, then the difference between the treatment and the control could be biased.
