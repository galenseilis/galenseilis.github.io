I saw the following diagram and wanted to give some feedback.

I agree with the spirit of the post that understanding food chains is improved in light of soil science. There are some concerns I have with both diagrams.


The left-hand diagram is a food web, which is a collection of food chains. Perhaps it is comprehensive enough as model in a particular project, but it seems quite incomplete. For some reason vertebrates take a strong majority of the diagram, ignoring almost all invertebrates. Likewise, there is no indication of microorganisms and only a single clade of plants. This kind of comprehensiveness is not necessary for pedagogy, but it is a limitation of these sorts of diagrams. A bigger limitation of this sort of diagram is that it gives the impression that food webs are directed acyclic graphs when it has been well-established that cycles exist in food webs.


The second diagram removes the need to speak of specific species or clades by abstracting to a "food chain". People can choose terminology as they like, but I would rather say that the second diagram shows a class of [food chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_chain). Often food chains are assumed to always ascend up a [total order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order) of [trophic levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic_level). This characterization is not entirely accurate of observed interactions, but it does communicate a tendency accurately. I think it is more principled to consider a [probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution) over [posets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set). For modelling purposes it is likely easier to model a stochastic directed graph, which would allow for violations in the typical partial orders. Lastly, food chains are supposed to have classes of organisms as nodes. While some have claimed that "soil is an organism", the arguments I have seen in its favour are subject to a [fallacy of composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_composition). In my opinion referring to decomposers, which often live in soil, would be more appropriate than simply "soil".
