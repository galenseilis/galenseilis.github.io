These are projects in their early infancy. I know I won't get around to all of this by myself. Let me know if you're interested in collaborating.

## Tool Development

### Kedro
- [ ] Develop plugin to run `PyCallGraph2` on the nodes, generating a call graph that ignores that Kedro code itself.
- [ ] Develop plugin which constructs Atlassian Confluence documentation based on the Kedro project.
- [ ] Develop `ESRIShapeFileDataset` for common geospatial analysis.
- [ ] Develop `ProphetModelDataset` using Prophets load/save methods.

### PyMC
- [ ] Bayesian tensor decomposition library.
- [ ] Bayesian queueing network library.
- [ ] Bayesian partial differential equation solver library.
- [ ] Bayesian symbolic regression.
- [ ] Bayesian tree of Dirichlet distributions.

### Scikit-Learn
- [ ] Trainable queueing network model class compliant with Scikit-Learn API.
- Numerically-stable hyperspherical rotations as a data transformation class compliant with Scikit-Learn API.

### Miscellaneous
- [ ] Library that summarizes a probability of properties hold of a random relation satisfying a given relation property.
- [ ] TDDA: [Type hint stubs?](https://github.com/tdda/tdda/issues/37)
- [ ] Implement an enumerator of automorphism orbits of directed hypergraphlets. See [Lugo-Martinez *et al* 2020](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/37/7/1000/5901538) for a related notion.


## Data Analysis
- [ ] Use [COBRApy](https://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1752-0509-7-74) to simulate metabolic flux in *Cyanidioschyzon merolae*.
- [ ] Develop statistical forecasting model of venting index in British Columbia, Canada.
- [ ] Orientation analysis of moose scat and other weak information. See [Seilis 2023](https://github.com/galenseilis/2023-01-27-moose-slides/blob/main/2023-01-27_Galen_Seilis_moose_orientation.pdf).
- [ ] Compute the [assembly index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_theory) of Canada's national road network and compare with the historical construction of the road network.
- [ ] Drawing The Bayesian Baboon: Apply an analysis similar to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnYhJzYAQ60) approach on [this data set](http://www.sociopatterns.org/datasets/baboons-interactions/).
- [ ] Graphlet automorphism orbit enumeration of British Columbia's road network followed by canonical correlation analysis between the graphlet orbit matrix with a matrix of vehicle incident risk factors.

## Mathematics
- [ ] Develop a generalization of the [Cramér–Rao bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram%C3%A9r%E2%80%93Rao_bound) for $k$-mode tensors.
- [ ] Derive the change of variables for a given random forest on a random vector with a given distribution.
- [ ] In [Seilis 2022](https://doi.org/10.24124/2022/59312) I developed the Agnesian operator. It clearly induces a form of differential equations which I would term "Agnesian equations". When two collections of functions given the same Agnesian, I call them "Agnesian-equivalent". It would be interesting to further explore this family of differential equations and their properties.
- [ ] Quantum Agnesians are a notion I had of bringing Agnesian operators to quantum operators.
