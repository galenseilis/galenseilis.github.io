A black distortion on a yellow puff,

I reached a hand out to grasp it.

Curiosity defeated by an insectile sting,

I cried aloud in consequence.

But why? What made it so?

Perhaps together is the way things go.

What handy rule if only it were so.

Correlation would not make it show.

A touch of information is needed,

but what is a Shannon, a nat, or divergence?

An inequality so subtle, so boring,

was all I needed to find convergence.
