I've come to a stage where I accept that I have more project ideas than I have time. So feel free to pick up on any of these ideas if you're looking for something to work on! Let me know if you or someone has already done these projects.

# Tool Development

## Kedro
- [ ] Develop plugin to run PyCallGraph2 on the nodes, generating a call graph that ignores that Kedro code itself.
- [ ] Develop `ESRIShapeFileDataset` for common geospatial analysis.
- [ ] Develop `ProphetModelDataset` using Prophets load/save methods.

## PyMC
- [ ] Bayesian tensor decomposition library.
- [ ] Bayesian queueing network library.
- [ ] Bayesian partial differential equation solver library.
- [ ] Bayesian symbolic regression.

## Scikit-Learn
-  [ ] Trainable queueing network model class compliant with Scikit-Learn API.

## Miscellaneous
- [ ] Library that summarizes a probability of elements of a random relation satisfying a given relation property.

# Data Analysis
- [ ] Use [COBRApy](https://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1752-0509-7-74) to simulate *Cyanidioschyzon merolae*.
- [ ] Develop statistical forecasting model of venting index in British Columbia, Canada.
- [ ] Orientation analysis of moose scat. (Yup, you read that right).

# Mathematics
- [ ] Develop a generalization of the [Cramér–Rao bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram%C3%A9r%E2%80%93Rao_bound) for $k$-mode tensors.
- [ ] Derive the change of variables for a given random forest on a random vector with a given distribution.
