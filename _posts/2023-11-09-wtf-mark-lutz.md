I have moments that I find amusing and frustrating when reading technical books. This post briefly shares one.

In *Learning Python* by Mark Lutz I read a section which both failed to even attempt to explain what PyPy's integrated tracing JIT compiler is when it was mentioned (in a section discussing PyPy), but apparently Mark felt the need to instead remind us that the phrasing "order of magnitude" means "factor of 10". 

What sort of writing style helps the reader with trivial side topics but doesn't explain the arcane technicalities it brings up about the main topic? I don't like it.
