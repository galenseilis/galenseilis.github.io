Starting in summer 2022 I decided to try painting. I stumbled upon videos of Bob Ross' *Joy of Painting* TV series and watching it over the course of a couple of weeks. I found it relaxing, as I have heard that many do, but in that time I started to wonder if *I* could paint. After all, Bob used to say that anyone could paint a picture. I decided to test that.

With nothing more than some painting supplies and a few weeks of watching Bob, I attempted a few paintings in 2022. The following are the first 6 paintings I attempting, haphazardly-ordered from top-left-to-bottom-right as 5th, 3rd, 4th, 1st, 2nd, and 6th.

And my 7th painting is down below.

I'll confess that my paintings are not great, but I am still proud of myself for trying. In truth, I promised myself before starting this journey not to try too hard to optimize my performance. I just wanted something that (1) I enjoy, (2) isn't analytical like my work or school, and (3) is something I can share with others. Something with a very different feeling from my other activities.

In these respects I think I have succeeded. I have enjoyed painting so far, and doing so at my own leisure makes it easy to do it only when I am up for it. While there are some surprisingly analytical aspects to 'how' painting works, I still find that there are lots of little subjective choices and an adventure to 'see how it turns out' when I try new things. And lastly, I have received positive feedback and reinforcement from friends and family to keep trying, and that they enjoy seeing the results of my efforts. I have even given away three of these paintings to people that enjoy them.
