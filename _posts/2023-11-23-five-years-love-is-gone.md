(Verse 1)
On a summer's eve, on my birthday night,
I met a love that shimmered so bright.
Her smile was a beacon in the dark,
But little did I know, she'd leave her mark.

(Chorus)
Oh, love that's gone, you took my happiness away,
You left me here with memories of that fateful day.
Though it's been five years since you said goodbye,
I'm still haunted by the tears I cry.

(Verse 2)
We danced beneath the moon's gentle glow,
Time stood still as our love began to grow.
But as the seasons changed, so did your heart,
And now we're worlds apart, torn apart.

(Chorus)
Oh, love that's gone, you took my happiness away,
You left me here with memories of that fateful day.
Though it's been five years since you said goodbye,
I'm still haunted by the tears I cry.

(Bridge)
Every birthday that comes and goes,
I'm reminded of the love I've lost, oh, how it shows.
The laughter and joy that we once shared,
Now replaced with sorrow, it's just not fair.

(Verse 3)
I've tried to move on, to find a new flame,
But your ghost lingers, haunting every name.
The candle flickers, casting shadows of regret,
For a love that's gone, I can't forget.

(Chorus)
Oh, love that's gone, you took my happiness away,
You left me here with memories of that fateful day.
Though it's been five years since you said goodbye,
I'm still haunted by the tears I cry.

(Outro)
But time will heal, or so they say,
Maybe someday I'll find a brighter day.
For now, I'll carry the lessons you taught,
A love that's gone, but not all is lost.
