The last week or so I've been watching videos by [The Hoof GP](https://www.youtube.com/c/thehoofgp), like this one for example:

It makes me happy thinking about how those cows will be more comfortable. In at least some of these videos I've noticed a song playing in the background. I searched "just say it out loud" on YouTube and found it:

Nothing in my life right now like what the lyrics in this song describe, but I could feel the vibe. I remember those grey cold skies.
