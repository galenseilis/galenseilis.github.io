Summer 2022 I tried painting for the first time since I was a child. It began with listening Bob Ross on YouTube because it was relaxing background. Over time drifted from *listening* to *watching*, and I started paying attention to *how* the painting was made. For a couple of weeks I watched these videos before bed, but I reached a point where I thought "*I got to at least try this*". And I did. I went into a craft shop, bought some canvas and paint, and followed along with Bob. Even though I am not very skilled, I'm glad I tried painting because I have discoverd the joy in it (as the name of the TV show was titled). You can take this journey too by starting to watch his videos. His first show is linked below, but you can find the others on YouTube as well.

I decided to ask ChatGPT to write the lyrics to give tribute to Bob Ross.

I asked ChatGPT:
> Write a tribute song to Bob Ross.

It responded by naming the chat session "Tribute to Bob Ross" and generated these lyrics.

> **Verse 1**:
>
> A gentle voice, a calming breeze
>
> Bob Ross paints with such ease
>
> A happy little tree, a mountain view
