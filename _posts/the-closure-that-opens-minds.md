In this post I want to share a heuristic I have used for most of my adult life. A [heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic) is "*any approach to problem solving or self-discovery that employs a practical method that is not guaranteed to be optimal, perfect, or rational, but is nevertheless sufficient for reaching an immediate, short-term goal or approximation*". Heuristics are important because we don't always have the opportunity to carefully analyze problems. Unlike intuitions, the process of the heuristic can be understood before, during, and after its application.

Have you ever noticed when someone presents some options and then claims "these are the only possibilities"?
