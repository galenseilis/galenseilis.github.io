I tried googling "what is a picture made with crayon called" and I consistently got suggestions for crayon etching, which is a more specific usage of crayons. I asked ChatGPT the following question

> What is a picture called when it is made with crayon? I don't mean a crayon etching, but just when crayons are used to make a picture.

ChatGPT responded by labelling the chat session "Crayon Drawing" and responded:

> A picture made with crayons is commonly referred to as a crayon drawing or a crayon artwork. It is a type of drawing or art made using wax crayons, which are sticks of colored wax that can be used to create various colors and textures on paper or other surfaces. Other terms that may be used to describe a picture made with crayons include crayon painting or crayon illustration, depending on the style and technique used.

That's good enough for me, so I've named the title of this post "Crayon Drawing 1". Maybe at some point I'll stop numbering my pictures and start naming them.

Anyway, before trying painting I picked up some crayons and tried to make a picture. Naturally, whenever I pick up a complex skill and "just try it" I make a ton of mistakes. But strangely I rather like this picture. It along with my other attempts at art represents my courage in accepting imperfection and lack of expertise when I creatively explore.
