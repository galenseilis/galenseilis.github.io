So far I have enjoyed using Kedro to build data science workflows. If you are unfamiliar with [Kedro](https://kedro.org/) you should check them out.

I have some public-facing projects in mind that I would like to develop with Kedro, and it would be nice to show a badge showcasing that they were developed with Kedro. I wasn't able to find an existing badge, but [I asked on Kedro's Slack channel](https://kedro-org.slack.com/archives/C03RKP2LW64/p1692416941176739) and got a quick response that [they would look into it](https://kedro-org.slack.com/archives/C03RKP2LW64/p1692438131032699?thread_ts=1692416941.176739&cid=C03RKP2LW64). 

Exciting!
