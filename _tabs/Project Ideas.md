I've come to a stage where I accept that I have more project ideas than I have time. So feel free to pick up on any of these ideas if you're looking for something to work on! Let me know if you or someone else has already done these projects.

# Tool Development

## Kedro
- [ ] Develop plugin to run `PyCallGraph2` on the nodes, generating a call graph that ignores that Kedro code itself.
- [ ] Develop plugin which constructs Atlassian Confluence documentation based on the Kedro project.
- [ ] Develop `ESRIShapeFileDataset` for common geospatial analysis.
- [ ] Develop `ProphetModelDataset` using Prophets load/save methods.

## PyMC
- [ ] Bayesian tensor decomposition library.
- [ ] Bayesian queueing network library.
- [ ] Bayesian partial differential equation solver library.
- [ ] Bayesian symbolic regression.

## Scikit-Learn
- [ ] Trainable queueing network model class compliant with Scikit-Learn API.

## Miscellaneous
- [ ] Library that summarizes a probability of properties hold of a random relation satisfying a given relation property.
- [ ] TDDA: [Type hint stubs?](https://github.com/tdda/tdda/issues/37)

# Data Analysis
- [ ] Use [COBRApy](https://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1752-0509-7-74) to simulate metabolic flux in *Cyanidioschyzon merolae*.
- [ ] Develop statistical forecasting model of venting index in British Columbia, Canada.
- [ ] Orientation analysis of moose scat. (Yup, you read that right).
- [ ] Compute the [assembly index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_theory) of Canada's national road network and compare with the historical construction of the road network.
- [ ] Drawing The Bayesian Baboon: Apply an analysis similar to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnYhJzYAQ60) approach on [this data set](http://www.sociopatterns.org/datasets/baboons-interactions/).

# Mathematics
- [ ] Develop a generalization of the [Cramér–Rao bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram%C3%A9r%E2%80%93Rao_bound) for $k$-mode tensors.
- [ ] Derive the change of variables for a given random forest on a random vector with a given distribution.
- [ ] In [Seilis 2022](https://doi.org/10.24124/2022/59312) I developed the Agnesian operator. It clearly induces a form of differential equations which I would term "Agnesian equations". When two collections of functions given the same Agnesian, I call them "Agnesian-equivalent". It would be interesting to further explore this family of differential equations and their properties.
- [ ] Quantum Agnesians are a notion I had of bringing Agnesian operators to quantum operators.
- [ ] Develop the notion of an automorphism orbit of directed hypergraphlets.
