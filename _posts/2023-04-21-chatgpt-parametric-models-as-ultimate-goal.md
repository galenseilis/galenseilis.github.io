The following video claims the following:

> "Arguably, the ultimate goal of research is to have precise mathematical parametric models, but often these nonparametric models are a necessary pit stop.

I asked ChatGPT a couple of questions about this. I've put the Q&A below.

> **Question**
>
> Is the ultimate goal of research to have precise mathematical parametric models?


> **Answer**
>
> While precise mathematical parametric models can be one goal of research in certain fields, it is not necessarily the ultimate goal of all research. The goals of research can vary depending on the field, the nature of the research question, and the methods and approaches being used.
>
> In many scientific disciplines, the ultimate goal of research is to understand and explain phenomena in the natural world or human behavior, and to generate new knowledge that can be used to improve our understanding of the world around us. This may involve developing mathematical models or other types of models, such as statistical or computational models, that can help describe and explain observed phenomena. However, the specific type of model or level of mathematical precision required may vary depending on the field and the research question being addressed.
>
> In some fields, such as physics or engineering, mathematical precision and the development of precise mathematical parametric models may indeed be a central goal of research, as these fields often rely heavily on mathematical theories and models to describe and predict natural phenomena or design systems. In other fields, such as social sciences or biology, the focus may be more on understanding complex systems with multiple variables, and the use of mathematical models may be more qualitative or descriptive in nature.
>
> It's also worth noting that research is a dynamic and evolving process, and the goals of research can change over time as our understanding of the world advances and new research questions emerge. The ultimate goal of research can vary depending on the stage of research, the context, and the specific objectives of a particular study or research program.

> **Question**
>
> Are nonparametric models a necessary pit stop toward having precise mathematical parametric models?


> **Answer**
>
> Nonparametric models are not necessarily a necessary pit stop toward having precise mathematical parametric models, as the choice between parametric and nonparametric models depends on the research question and the nature of the data being analyzed.
>
> Nonparametric models do not rely on specific assumptions about the distribution of the data or the relationship between variables, and therefore they can be more flexible and adaptable to a wider range of data types and research questions. Nonparametric methods can also be used to explore patterns in the data and identify potential relationships between variables, which can inform the development of more precise parametric models.
>
> Parametric models, on the other hand, make specific assumptions about the distribution of the data and the relationship between variables, and they require a priori knowledge about the form of the model. Parametric models can be more precise and accurate in situations where the assumptions are met, but they may not be appropriate for all types of data and research questions.
>
> In some cases, researchers may start with nonparametric models to explore the data and identify potential relationships, and then use this information to develop more precise parametric models that can be used to make more accurate predictions or test specific hypotheses. However, in other cases, nonparametric models may be sufficient for the research question and may not need to be replaced by parametric models.
>
> Ultimately, the choice between nonparametric and parametric models depends on the specific research question and the nature of the data being analyzed, and both types of models can play important roles in the research process.
