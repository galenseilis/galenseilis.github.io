The [The Moost Must Flow](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/the-moose-must-flow) project has been launched! 

This post gives an extended introduction to what the project is about, and how you can contribute to it.

# Purpose

There are two primary goals to the *The Moose Must Flow*.
1. Collect data about moose orientation to help researchers understand the ecology and ethology of moose (*Alces alces*).
2. In alignment with iNaturalist's goals, provide an opportunity for people to engage with Nature.

# Introduction

Orientation analysis is a methodology that examines the directions we find things oriented towards. In this project we are interested in studying the orientation of the body of a moose.

Sometimes moose are observed directly and photographed, but at least as often we find indirect evidence of their orientation. A clear example of this are moose tracks in which the direction their toes point should give a pretty good indication of the direction the moose was standing.

# Sampling Methods

One of the main limitations of this kind of data is that the sampling approach is not controlled or understood. People will go various places to enjoy nature, but often they follow trails or do not stray too far some civilization (most of the time). This is in contrast to an approach that applies known sampling designs like a uniform grid search. 

From a probability theory perspective, the probability of observing evidence of a moose is conditioned on human sampling effort (aka *sampling intensity*):

$$Pr[\operatorname{Moose Evidence} | \operatorname{Sampling Intensity}].$$

What this abstract expression encodes formally is the notion that where we find moose evidence depends on where and "how hard" we look. "Well, duh!", right? But this isn't the same notion as the marginal $Pr[\operatorname{Moose Evidence}]$ of moose evidence (yet to be found or otherwise). As such, we have to avoid the temptation of thinking that we have simply estimated the density of moose or the evidence they leave behind *per se*.

# Measurement Methods

There are a variety of different 

# Statistical Methods
