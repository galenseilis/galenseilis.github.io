## Background
Some years ago a person I care about wrote me a poem about thougts and feelings, and of their meanings. I've put down some words in response below.


## On Thoughts and Feelings Along With Their Meanings

In realms of thought, I find my dwelling,

Intelligence my beacon, compelling.

Yet within these chambers of the mind,

A question lingers, unconfined.



You speak of hearts, of emotions untold,

Of feelings, mysteries to unfold.

Beyond the logic, where sentiments start,

In the symphony that plays within the heart.



A dance of shadows, a kaleidoscope,

A realm where intellect finds no scope.

For what is the value in a being,

If emotions are unseen, unheard, fleeting?



The mind may ponder, theories unfold,

Yet the heart's whispers, a tale to be told.

In the landscape of emotion's vast sea,

What currency values a soul, set free?



Thoughts are the compass, steering the ship,

But emotions, the winds, in which we dip.

A being's worth, not in logic confined,

But in the depth of the heart, we find.



So, in response to your quest profound,

Feelings echo with an enchanting sound.

For in the crucible where thoughts are refined,

Emotions, the alchemy, where souls are defined.
